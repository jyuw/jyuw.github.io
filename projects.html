          <hr>
          <p>Lyra and her daemon moved through the darkening hall, taking care
            to keep to one side, out of sight of the kitchen. The three great
            tables that ran the length of the hall were laid already, the
            silver and the glass catching what little light there was, and the
            long benches were pulled out ready for the guests. Portraits of
            former Masters hung high up in the gloom along the walls. Lyra
            reached the dais and looked back at the open kitchen door, and,
            seeing no one, stepped up beside the high table. The places here
            were laid with gold, not silver, and the fourteen seats were not
            oak benches but mahogany chairs with velvet cushions. </p>

          <h2> A Soliloquy</h2>
          <hr>
          <p> Lyra stopped beside the Master's chair and flicked the biggest
            glass gently with a fingernail. The sound rang clearly through the
            hall. <br> <br> "You're not taking this seriously," whispered her
            daemon. "Behave yourself." <br> Her daemon's name was Pantalaimon,
            and he was currently in the form of a moth, a dark brown one so
            as not to show up in the darkness of the hall. <br><br> "They're
            making too much noise to hear from the kitchen," Lyra whispered
            back. "And the Steward doesn't come in till the first bell.
            Stop fussing." </p>
