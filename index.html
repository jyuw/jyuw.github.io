          <h2> There is stuff here</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world.
            There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly
            half full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are those
            who say: this glass is half empty.<br/><br/>

            The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and
            say: ‘What’s up with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my
            glass? I don’t think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger
            glass! And at the other end of the bar the world is full of the other
             type of person, who has a broken glass, or a glass that has been
             carefully knocked over (usually by one of the people calling for
             a larger glass), or who had no glass at all, because they were at
             the back of the crowd and had failed to catch the barman’s eye</p>

          <h2> Also here</h2>
          <hr>
          <p> I've been eaten by a dragon, he thought. That's ridiculous,
            he replied, you can't see out of dragons. Then his shoulder hit
            the door at the far end of the tunnel, and he followed it through
            into a cone-shaped room that was even stranger than the tunnel. It
            was full of tiny glittering lights. Among the lights, in contoured
            chairs, were four men who were now staring at him open-mouthed. As
            he stared back he saw their gazes dart sideways. Rincewind turned
            slowly. Beside him was a fifth man - youngish, bearded, as swarthy
            as the nomad folk of the Great Nef.
            <br><br>
            "Where am I?" said the wizard. "in the belly of a dragon?"</p>
