          <p>From his beltpouch he took a heavy gold signet ring worked with a
             flying crane and turned it over and over in his fingers.
             The ring of the Malkieri kings, worn by men who had held back
             the Shadow nine hundred years and more. Countless times it had
             been remade as time wore it down, always the old ring melted
             to become part of the new. Some particle might still exist in
             it of the ring worn by the rulers of Rhamdashar, that had
             lived before Malkier, and Aramaelle that had been before
             Rhamdashar. That piece of metal represented over three thousand
             years fighting the Blight.</p>

          <hr>
          <p> In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel,
              stood the full-length portrait of a young man of
              extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some
              little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil
              Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago
              caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise
              to so many strange conjectures.
              As he looked at the gracious and comely form he had
              so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed
              across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he
              suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed his
              fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison
              within his brain some curious dream from which he feared
              he might awake.</p>
